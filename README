This was a simple little jQuery plugin that @nummi and I were
messing around with. A global style observer pattern in the 
event pooling style. What can I say, we were thinking about 
how Cocoa does it and thought, why can't we do this in JavaScript.

Sure... Bind is pretty similar but we wanted something to do. :) 

Mess with it if you like. Enjoy!
